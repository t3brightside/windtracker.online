# WindTracker.online

**Track live wind observations from weather stations around the globe.**

WindTracker.online aggregates data from various **Open Data APIs** provided by different national weather services. Please note that data availability, update intervals, and station coverage vary widely between countries.

### Add a New Country / Data Source

Want to expand coverage? We welcome **Python scripts** that can pull new data! The script should retrieve the latest observations, including station locations, and write the data to a **JSON file** matching the structure below.

```json
{
    "resolution_minutes": 60,
    "stations": [
        {
            "name": "Station Name",
            "longitude": 25.54916,
            "latitude": 60.30373,
            "precipitations": 0.1,
            "airtemperature": 8.9,
            "winddirection": 158.0,
            "windspeed": 8.6,
            "windspeedmax": 10.2
        }
    ]
}
```

## Disclaimer and Support

**Data Accuracy & Reliability:** Due to the nature of relying on third-party public APIs (which are not 100% reliable and tend to change), there is no warranty on data accuracy or app functionality whatsoever.

**This is a passion project;** tracking API changes, fixing issues, and developing new features can be time-consuming. Therefore, fixes and updates may not be immediate.

**Want to support development?** You'll find a donation button in the app's main menu. It would be a great inspiration to take the project further!
